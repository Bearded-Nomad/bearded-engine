This is a learning project. Feel free to use *if it works*.
---

**Purpose:**
- Ease the process to make a game by not calling Raylib everytime
- Work on any computer (mine is a MacBookPro from 2010 with a non-functional graphic card)
- Will make me understand more things about game developpment and programming in Odin

**Things to do:**
1. First things:
    - Get a window
    - Print images where I want it
    - Make said images move
    - Play sounds at will

2. After it works:
    - Animations
    - Collisions

3. More to come...

---

This will use [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) as language and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) as it is simple and provided in vendor packages.
I want it to be as simple as it could be to anyone who wants to make games. I'll put examples as the code grow and a game example that I'll build along the way.
Again, feel free to use or modify, but if you can say where it come from it will be much appreciated.
